            Machine Learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in AI by providing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms power many of the AI applications we encounter daily, from personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to predictive maintenance in manufacturing.ML has transformed industries by enabling more accurate forecasts, better risk assessments, and data- driven decision-making. As the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, ML becomes increasingly important for extracting valuable insights and knowledge from vast datasets that wouldbe impractical or impossible for humans to process manually.
